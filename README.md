# Functional Gradients
### Interindividual variability of across the LifeSpan

This branch is an adaptation of the gradient-extraction pipeline (alberti-f/FunctionalGradients) based on the directory structure of the Human Connectome LifeSpan data. These scriptas are part of a larger project investigating how interindividual variability patterns change across the lifespan in association to cognitive performance.
